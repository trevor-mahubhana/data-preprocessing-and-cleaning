## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to my **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** repository! This collection demonstrates practical techniques to transform raw, messy data into analysis-ready datasets. Perfect for data scientists, analysts, and students looking for reusable workflows to handle common data quality challenges.

## 🗂 Projects Overview
This repository currently includes **1 project** (with more coming soon!) covering essential data wrangling tasks:

### 🔍 Data Quality Assessment
- Exploratory analysis to identify inconsistencies, duplicates, and anomalies
- Data profiling and validation checks

### 🧩 Handling Imperfect Data
- **Missing values**: Imputation (mean, median, predictive models)
- **Outliers**: Detection and treatment (IQR, z-score, winsorization)

### 🔄 Data Transformation
- Normalization (Min-Max, StandardScaler)
- Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot, Label, Target Encoding)

### ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Feature creation and binning
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trevor-mahubhana/data-preprocessing-and-cleaning.git
